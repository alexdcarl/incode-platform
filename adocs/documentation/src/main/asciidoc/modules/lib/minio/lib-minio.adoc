This module (`incode-module-minio-dom`) and its various submodules  provides a libray for archiving BLOBs from a domain entity and persisting them instead using link:https://www.minio.io/[Minio].

The idea is that domain entities such as documents, that large blob/clob content initially persist that content "in-line".
At some later point, that content is copied from the domain entity into Minio, and then that content is removed.
In its place the URL of the content as persisted in Minio is stored as a pointer.


Most of the functionality provided by this module is intended to be used by an integration solution - such as Apache Camel - rather than an Apache Isis domain application, and can be used "as-is".

The module also provides an SPI for the Apache Isis domain app to implement, acting as a bridge to the specifics of the domain app and the entities it may require archiving.



== Architecture

The diagram below sketches the components provided by this module, and how they interact:

image::{_imagesdir}/design-sketch.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}/design-sketch.png"]


The central algorithm is implemented by `MinioArchiver` (in the `incode-module-minio-minioarchlib` submodule).
This:

* calls `DomainObjectPropertyClient` to obtain a list of all documents that need to be archived.
+
The `DomainObjectPropertyClient` is the `incode-module-minio-dopclient` submodule.

* The `DomainObjectClient` in turn makes a REST call to `DomainObjectPropertyService`, hosted by the Apache Isis webapp.
+
The `DomainObjectPropertyService` is in the `incode-module-minio-dopserver` submodule, and so this is the one dependency that an Apache Isis webapp has on the Minio library.

* within the Apache Isis webapp, the `DomainObjectPropertyService` delegates to the `DomainObjectPropertyServiceBridge`.
+
This is an SPI that the consuming application is required to implement.
Typically this is likely to delegate to some repository service to obtain entity/ies that have blobs/clobs, eg documents.

* for each of the returned blobs, the `MinioArchiver` then calls the `MinioUploadClient` to upload the blob into Minio itself (clobs are converted to UTF-8 encoded byte arrays).
This returns back a URL.
+
The `MinioUploadClient` is in the `incode-module-minio-minioclient` submodule.

* for each blob and its corresponding URI, the `MinioArchiver` then calls the `DomainObjectPropertyClient` once more, this time to indicate that the blob has been archived.

* the `DomainObjectPropertyClient` in turn again makes a REST call up to `DomainObjectPropertyService`, hosted on the Apache Isis webapp.

* once more the `DomainObjectPropertyService` delegates to the `DomainObjectPropertyServiceBridge` SPI.
+
The implementation of this (provided by the consuming application) will typically delete the blob/clob from the original entity, and in its place store the provided URL as a pointer to the content now stored in Minio.
+
[NOTE]
====
It's the responsibility of the consuming application to download the content from Minio (using the URL); this library does not (currently) provide any utility services for this.
====

The `MinioArchiver` described above is packaged as a library, so will typically be called periodically from some sort of integration solution.
As the diagram above suggests, this could be accomplished using Apache Camel, whereby a `MinioArchiverProcessor` (not part of this library) acts as a simple wrapper that calls the `MinioArchiver`.
That processer in turn might be scheduled to run periodically, say once an hour.

When first deploying this solution, there will probably be a need to archive historical blobs.
The `Main` utility in the `incode-module-minio-minioarchtool` is a standalone utility that simply calls the `MinioArchiver` to archive all.

[[__lib-minio_url-format]]
== URL format

The format of the URLs created by `MinioUploadClient` is:

`http://minioserver/myapp/prod/cust.Customer/1234/photo`

where:

* `http://minioserver`
+
is the base URL which hosts the server

* `myapp`
+
is the S3 _bucket_ to use.
This represents the application with responsibility for the Blob, and therefore how to interpret the remainder of the URL.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This concept is discussed further below.
====

* `prod`
+
is a fixed value representing the particular _instance_ of the application that is running, such as "dev", "test" or "prod".

* "cust.Customer/1234"
+
is the identifier of (in this case) a customer.
It corresponds to the bookmark of the Apache Isis application (having replaced '/' with ':').

* `photo`
+
is the property containing the blob

The concept of bucket is very important and is discussed further below.

=== (Application) Buckets

In addition to the Apache Isis webapp using minio, there may well be other applications on the network that are acting as minio clients, such as file scanner or OCR engine.
The URL scheme is designed to accommodate this, with the _bucket_ acting as a namespace for all blobs that belong (which is to say, were created by) a particular application.

Note that the bucket corresponds to the owning the application as a piece of software, rather than a particular instance of the application running in production or test, for example.
The remainder of the URL (after the bucket prefix) therefore must be unique across all such instances.

In the case of this minio library, the remaining URL includes an _instance_ portion to distinguish the various instances of the application that may be running, and then relies upon the intrinsic uniqueness that Apache Isis itself guarantees of the `Bookmark` of every domain object.

Other clients of minio (file scanner or OCR) are free to use some other scheme, for example physical barcodes on documents, or a random GUID.
To reiterate, the responsibility of generating a unique suffix (across all instances) within a bucket is the responsibility of the application that owns that particular bucket.

=== "Foreign" References

While all URLs within a particular bucket have an application as their owner, it _is_ valid for one application to refer to URLs created by some other application.

For example, a scanning/OCR system might upload PDFs into minio, and use a barcode physically attached to each PDF to form the unique id.
Such a minio blob might have a URL of `http://minioserver/scanner/0100112401`, where `0100112401` is the barcode number.

If this PDF was to be handled by the Apache Isis webapp (eg it represented an invoice to be paid), then a `Document` entity of some sort could be created in the Apache Isis webapp which referenced that external URL.
So, while the `Document` entity is part of the Apache Isis app, it references a minio image that was created by some other app (the scanning app).


=== Application-specific Metadata

Minio (as an implementation of Amazon S3) allows HTTP headers to be associated with any given blob.
Two are specified by default:

* `Content-Type` : also known as the mime-type, for example "image/jpeg"
* `File-Name` : the file name, eg "butterfly.jpg"

In addition, S3 allows custom metadata to be associated; such metadata must have the prefix "X-Amz-Meta-".
The `MinioUploadClient` will automatically prefix any custom metadata headers.
However, it will also include the bucket name as a secondary prefix.

For example, for the bucket "MyApp", all keys will have the prefix "X-Amz-Meta-MyApp-".
If the key already has this prefix, then only the missing parts will be associated.

.Custom metadata prefixes
[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

| Key provided
| Actual key used

| Foo
| X-Amz-Meta-MyApp-Foo

| MyApp-Foo
| X-Amz-Meta-MyApp-Foo

| X-Amz-Meta-MyApp-Foo
| X-Amz-Meta-MyApp-Foo

|===

The upload client adds the bucket as a second-level prefix in order to support "foreign" references, explained earlier.
For example:

* if the scanner application creates the blob `http://minioserver/scanner/0100112401`, then it might attach the metadata `X-Amz-Meta-Scanner-ScannedBy=john.doe`.

* later on, another application might reference this same URL but add its own metadata, eg `X-Amz-Meta-InvoiceApp-ApprovedBy=freda.smith`.

This therefore provides a scheme whereby metadata can be added by various interested apps to an image originally uploaded by any arbitrary other app.


== Integration solution (eg Apache Camel)

This section describes how to configure and use the minio library within the integration solution (eg Apache Camel), ie that periodically invokes the `MinioArchiver`.


=== Classpath

Update your classpath by adding these dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-minio-minioarchlib</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-minio-minioarchlib[Maven Central Repo].



=== Apache Camel Example Processor

If using Apache Camel as the integration solution, then the code below can be used as a basis for a processor:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.Exchange;
import org.apache.camel.Processor;
import org.incode.module.minio.minioarchlib.MinioArchiveAll;
import lombok.Setter;

public class MinioArchiverProcessor implements Processor {

    private static final int MAX_ITERATIONS = 5;

    @Setter
    private MinioArchiver minioArchiver;

    @Override
    public void process(final Exchange exchange) {

        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; i++) {
                int numArchived = minioArchiver.archive("camel");
                LOG.info(numArchived + " archived");
                if (numArchived == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        } catch(Throwable ex) {
            LOG.error(ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
----

This invokes the `MinioArchiver` up to 5 times.
The idea here is to allow the archiving to be performed in batches, avoiding very large database updates during initial migration of blobs from the Apache Isis webapp and into Minio.


=== Apache Camel Spring-based config

If running inside of Apache Camel and using Spring to configure the components:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:camel="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
       http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">

    <bean id="minioArchiverProcessor"
          class="org.incode.ecp.est2minio.route.MinioArchiverProcessor">
        <property name="minioArchiver" ref="minioArchiver"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="minioArchiver"
          class="org.incode.module.minio.minioarchlib.MinioArchiveAll">
        <property name="dopClient" ref="domainObjectPropertyClient"/>
        <property name="minioUploadClient" ref="minioUploadClient"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="minioUploadClient"
          class="org.incode.module.minio.minioclient.MinioUploadClient"
          init-method="init">
        <property name="url"       value="${minio.baseUrl}"/>
        <property name="accessKey" value="${minio.accessKey}"/>
        <property name="secretKey" value="${minio.secretKey}"/>
        <property name="bucket"    value="${minio.bucket}"/>
        <property name="prefix"    value="${minio.prefix}"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="domainObjectPropertyClient"
          class="org.incode.module.minio.dopclient.DomainObjectPropertyClient"
          init-method="init">
        <property name="base" value="${apacheIsisWebapp.baseUrl}"/>
        <property name="username" value="${apacheIsisWebapp.username}"/>
        <property name="password" value="${apacheIsisWebapp.password}"/>
    </bean>

    ...
</beans>
----

This requires the following configuration properties to be defined:

* `minio.baseUrl` - base URL for minio server (to upload to)
* `minio.accessKey` - user account to access minio
* `minio.secretKey` - corresponding password for the minio user account
* `minio.bucket` - as explained in the xref:lib-minio.adoc#__lib-minio_url-format[above section] on the URL format, typically indicates the "environment"
* `minio.prefix` - as explained in the xref:lib-minio.adoc#__lib-minio_url-format[above section] on the URL format, typically indicates the source of the blob
* `apacheIsisWebapp.baseUrl` - base URL for the Apache Isis webapp (to read blobs from)
* `apacheIsisWebapp.username` - user account to access Apache Isis webapp
* `apacheIsisWebapp.password` - corresponding password for the Apache Isis webapp

The Camel route that invokes the `MinioArchiverProcessor` (in the same file) is defined as:

[source,xml]
----
<beans ...>
    ...

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring" id="minio">
        <route id="minioFromQuartz">
            <from uri="quartz://camel/estatioToMinio?cron=30+*+7-18+?+*+MON-FRI"/>
            <camel:process ref="minioArchiverProcessor"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

Here the configuration for the `quartz` source is to run once an hour, from 7am to 6pm:

* `30` - seconds: at 30 seconds past the minute only
* `*` - minutes: every minute
* `7-18` - hours:  from 7 til 18.  First three parts imply therefore running every minute, 7:00 to 18:00
* `?` - day-of-month: omit, because cannot specify both this and also day-of-week (below)
* `*` - month-of-year: every month of the year
* `MON-FRI` - day-of-week: only mondays to fridays

[NOTE]
====
'+' separates the parts (same as URL encoding a space)

== Apache Isis application

This section describes the responsibilities of the Apache Isis webapp that has domain entities with blobs that are to be archived.

=== SPI

The consuming Apache Isis application is required to implement the `DomainObjectPropertyProvider` SPI.
It uses the `DomainObjectProperty` is a DTO that identifies the source entity and property which holds the blob or clob, also indicating which type it is:

[source,java]
.DomainObjectProperty.java
----
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class DomainObjectProperty {

    public enum Type { BLOB,CLOB }

    private final String bookmark;
    private final String property;
    private final Type type;

    public DomainObjectProperty(final Bookmark bookmark, final String property, final Type type) {
        this(bookmark.toString(), property, type);
    }
}
----

There can be multiple implementations of `DomainObjectPropertyProvider`, and all will be called following a chain-of-responsibility pattern.
The SPI for `DomainObjectPropertyProvider` itself is:

[source,java]
.DomainObjectPropertyProvider.java
----
public interface DomainObjectPropertyProvider {

    void findToArchive(List<DomainObjectProperty> appendTo);                 // <1>

    boolean supportsBlobFor(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop);                 // <2>
    Blob blobFor(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop);                            // <3>
    void blobArchived(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop, String externalUrl);   // <4>

    boolean supportsClobFor(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop);                 // <5>
    Clob clobFor(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop);                            // <5>
    void clobArchived(Object domainObject, DomainObjectProperty dop, String externalUrl);   // <5>
}
----
<1> For all domain objects with properties requiring archiving, create a `DomainObjectProperty` and append to the provided list.
+
A typical implementation will run a query against a specific repository (eg `DocumentRepository`) and find newly-created instances with ``Blob``s or ``Clob``s to be archived.

<2> Acts as a guard for the `blobFor(...)` and `blobArchived(...)` methods that follow, allowing an implementation to indicate whether it recognises the provided domain object and associated `DomainObjectProperty`.
+
A typical implementation should check the type of the provided `domainObject` and also optionally the `DomainObjectProperty`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Strictly speaking the identity of the domain object is also encoded in `DomainObjectProperty`, and so passing in the domain object is redundant.
However, it makes for a more convenient API, and saves the implementation having to lookup the domain object using the `BookmarkService`.
====

<3> Extracts the blob from the specified domain object, for the property specified by `DomainObjectProperty`.
+
A typical implementation will just return the value of the appropriate property of the domain object.

<4> Once the blob has been archived off to minio, then this method is called to notify the domain object that of the external URL.
+
A typical implementation will store the external URL somewhere, quite possibly in the source entity, and the may nullify the blob.

<5> Equivalent methods for clobs rather than blobs.



=== Classpath

Update your classpath by adding these dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-minio-dopserver</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-minio-dopserver[Maven Central Repo].


=== Bootstrapping

The SPI service implementation must be included in the application bootstrapping.
Typically this is done by defining an owning `Module` and then including that module in the application's `AppManifest`.

=== Related Services

As a convenience, the library also provides `BlobClobDownloadService`:

[source,java]
.BlobClobDownloadService.java
----
@DomainService( ... )
public class BlobClobDownloadService {

    public Blob downloadBlob(
            final String documentName,
            final String externalUrl)
            throws IOException, ApplicationException { ... }

    @Programmatic
    public Clob downloadClob(
            final String documentName,
            final String externalUrl)
            throws IOException, ApplicationException { ... }
}
----



== Dependencies

For the Apache Isis webapp, this library has no dependencies.
