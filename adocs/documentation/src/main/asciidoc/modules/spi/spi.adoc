SPI modules provide implementations of SPIs defined by the Apache Isis framework itself.
As the table below shows, these are typically for cross-cutting concerns such as auditing.

|xref:audit/spi-audit.adoc#[Audit]
| Persists records of changes (one record per changed property) using an `AuditEntry` entity.

| (none)

|xref:command/spi-command.adoc#[Command]
| Persist action invocations and property edits as `CommandJdo` entities.

This enables profiling and (in conjunction with the xref:audit/spi-audit.adoc#[Audit] module) enhanced auditing.

|xref:errorrptslack/spi-errorrptslack.adoc#[ErrorReportingSlack]
| Whenever the error page is displayed to the user, automatically post the details to a Slack channel and display an random image.

The default implementation shows a random kitten (!), but this can be customised.

|xref:security/spi-security.adoc#[Security]
| Provides the ability to manage users, roles, and permissions, by way of an _Apache Shiro_ realm.

Users have roles, roles have permissions, and permissions are associated with application features (derived from the Apache Isis metamodel).

Permissions themselves can either _allow_ or _veto_ the ability to _view_ or _change_ any application feature.
