Finally, it's also possible to package up and run the webapp as a Docker container.

* to package the webapp as a Docker image:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp \
    -o \
    -Dmavenmixin-docker \
    -Ddocker-plugin.imageName=mycompany/myapp \
    docker:build
----
+
where "imageName" is anything you want. +
+
The configuration for the docker plugin is done using the _docker_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#_quickstart_maven-mixins[below].


* and to run it:

+
[source,bash]
----
docker container run -p 8080:8080 -d mycompany/myapp
----


[NOTE]
====
On Windows, you may need to enable the Docker daemon first, otherwise the "mvn install" command above will fail:

image::{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/010-docker-localhost-2375.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/010-docker-localhost-2375.png"]

You might also need to ensure that the "Unidentified networks" are configured to be private:

image::{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/026-docker-nat-private.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/026-docker-nat-private.png"]

This can be done using the "Local Security Policy" application.

This will bootstrap the application; `docker container ps` will show all running containers.
Alternatively, Kitematic provides a simple UI to view and interact with running containers:

image::{_imagesdir}running/docker/kitematic.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}running/docker/kitematic.png"]

When the application is started this way, it runs without any fixtures.
There are a variety of ways to override this but these easiest is probably to use the `$ISIS_OPT` environment variable, a set of key:value pairs concatenated together.

The `scripts/rundocker.sh` script is a simple wrapper that reads all properties from an externally specified configuration file and starts the docker container correctly.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
pushd scripts
rundocker.sh mycompany/myapp isis-overrides.properties -p 8080:8080
popd
----

where

* `mycompany/myapp` is the name of the image to be run

* `-p 8080:8080` is passed through to the `docker run` command
