The quickstart app consists of five Maven modules: a parent module and four submodules.
The diagram below shows their dependencies:

image::{_imagesdir}project-structure/module-dependencies/Slide1.PNG[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}project-structure/module-dependencies/Slide1.PNG"]

where:

* `quickstart-module-simple` is where the business logic resides for an initial "simple" module. +
+
This consists of nothing more than a `SimpleObject` and supporting menu and repository (basically the same domain as generated by Apache Isis' link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun/ugfun.html#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp] archetype). +
+
In your own application we recommend that you clone this module for each discrete module that makes up your business domain.
Doing this from the very beginning will help ensure your app doesn't become the proverbial "big ball of mud".

* It's quite common to factor out base/abstract classes to remove boilerplate, or to hold utility classes.
The `quickstart-module-base` module is an ideal place for this, intended as a base module that all business modules will depend upon.
It is also where the example xref:../modules/ext/togglz/ext-togglz.adoc#[togglz] feature toggle `enum` class resides.

* The `quickstart-appdefn` module holds the application's implementation of the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgcms/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[AppManifest] interface, which defines the modules that make up the application.
The quickstart's implementation is `domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifest`. +
+
It's also a useful place to define fixtures for demoing prototypes to the business, as well as supporting services that might be needed to help configure modules.
The quickstart includes implementations of services for both the xref:../modules/spi/security/spi-security.adoc#[security spi] module and the xref:../modules/ext/security/ext-togglz.adoc#[togglz] (feature toggle) module.

* Finally, the `quickstart-webapp` module is what packages up the application as a `.war` file (the `WEB-INF/web.xml` shown in the diagram actually lives in this module).
There's very little Java code in this module: the most significant class is `DomainAppWicketApplication` (extends `IsisWicketApplication`), required by the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugvw/ugvw.html[Wicket viewer].


You'll want to load the generated app into an IDE; the figure below shows the app as loaded into IntelliJ:

image::{_imagesdir}project-structure/quickstart-app-loaded-into-intellij.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}project-structure/quickstart-app-loaded-into-intellij.png"]

by default the `example` modules are excluded from the project:

See the Apache Isis documentation for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg/dg.html#__dg_ide_intellij_importing-maven-modules[further guidance].


== Adding/removing modules

By default the `DomainAppAppManifest` app manifest has dependencies on _all_ of the xref:../modules/spi/spi.adoc#[SPI services], _all_ of the xref:../modules/wkt/wkt.adoc#[wicket components], the (feature) xref:../modules/ext/togglz/ext-togglz.adoc#[togglz] extension module, the xref:../modules/dom/settings/dom-settings.adoc#[settings] subdomain (used by the togglz extension), and the xref:../modules/mml/paraname8/mml-paraname8.adoc#[paraname8] metamodel facet.

To exclude the modules that you don't require, delete or comment entries in the app manifest.
To keep things tidy, you should probably also remove the corresponding ``<dependency>``s from your application's `pom.xml` files.

Conversely, the application does _not_ include any of the xref:../modules/dom.adoc#[generic subdomains] nor xref:../modules/lib.adoc#[libraries].
To include these, take a look at the xref:quickstart-with-example-usage.adoc#[quickstart with example usage], or just read the individual documentation for the required module(s).
In many cases all that's required is to update the `pom.xml` to reference the required module, and reference its `XxxModule` class in your app manifest.
