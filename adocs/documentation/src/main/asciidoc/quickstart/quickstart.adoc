The quickstart is a Maven archetype intended to be used as a template for new applications.

Like the Apache Isis framework's own link:http://isis.apache.org#guides/ugfun/ugfun.html#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype], the application provides a `SimpleObject` to adapt and copy, along with supporting unit tests, integration tests and BDD (cucumber) specs.

The application generated from the archetype is also preconfigured with the dependencies for all of the modules available in the Incode Platform, with xref:../modules/spi/audit/spi-audit.adoc#[auditing], xref:../modules/spi/command/spi-command.adoc#[command] profiling, xref:../modules/spi/security/spi-security.adoc#[security], xref:../modules/ext/flywaydb/ext-flywaydb.adoc#[flywaydb] and (feature) xref:../modules/ext/togglz/ext-togglz.adoc#[togglz] enabled by default.
The application also configures the _Quartz scheduler_ for background scheduling, and the _Jolokia_ servlet, allowing consoles such as _hawt.io_ to monitor the internal state of the webapp.
