== Building

The platform is built simply from the root directory:

[source,bash]
-----
mvn clean install
-----

This builds the `modules`, `platformapp` and `quickstart` app.

The `quickstart` archetype (reverse engineered from the `quickstart` application) is built through a separate process.


== Testing & Developing

Load the `platformapp`
